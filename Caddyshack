FADE IN
EXT. NOONAN HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
It 1 s seven o'clock and the birds are singing in the trees
outside un old, two-story frame house with a sagging front
porch and peeling white paint, only half-covered by a partial
paint job.
MRS. NOONAN {v.o.)
(shouting cheerily)
Let's go kids! Rise and shine! Let's
hit the deck! Let's go-go-go!
A dog begins BARKING.
INT. UPSTAIRS EALLWAY
Doors fly open and a half dozen children start pouring into
the hall, rucing for the bathroom, und rough-housing down
the stairs.
MRS. NOONAN
She stands at the foot of the stairs calling up to the gang
of kids. She's a plump, cheerful woman with a helpful,
supportive manner. The family COLLIE runs up the stair~
still BARKING.
MRS. NOONAN
(calling out)
Up, up, up! Andy? Billy? I 1m
not hearing any movement up there!
Make sure Danny's up, please. Uppieuppie everybody!
INT. DANNY NOONAN' S BEDROOM - DAWN
The first light of day filters through the window revealing
un incredibly messy boy's bedroom littered with dirty laundry[
books, comics, broken toys and an electric guitur. The w2lls
arc covered with KISS posters, framed athletic awards anu
cheesy trophies ona homernade bookshelf, Little League team
pictures and a poster-sized blow-up of ,lohn Belushi. A broken
model spaceship dangl~s from a thread from the ceiling fixture.
Three brothers share the room. ANDY and BILLY, twelve and
thirteen are getting dressed. DANNY NOONAN, age eighteen,
sits on the edge of his bRd rubbing his eyes. He's a manly,
good-looking, dthletic kid with a kind of quick, naturctl
intelligence -- the oldest and biggest o f the Noonan kids.

'I'm up.

DANNY
(shouts)
He hops out of bed and heads for the bathroom.
HALLWAY
BILLY, ED and KATHLEEN are already lined up at the bathroom
door, waiting impatiently in their pajamas .
DANNY
(impatiently)
Who's in there?
KATHLEEN
Danny, will you tell Nancy to get
out of there?
BILLY
She's been in there an hour!
Danny goes right to the bathroom door, knocks once and barges in,
catching twelve year old NANCY in h e r panties, he r mother's
rouge and lip s tick smeared on her mouth.
DANNY
Come on, Nance!
NANCY
(screams)
Danny!
She grabs her robe and runs out.
NANCY
· (off camera)
Mother! Danny saw me naked!
DANNY
There's not much to se e .
Danny puts some Crest on his toothbrush and leaves the
bathroom.
THE HALLWAY
As Danny comes out : Billy, Ed and Kathleen f ight to get in ·
next.
ED
I'm next! I called it!

KATHLEEN
(pushing him)
Oh no you don't!
BILLY
Shotgun!
Danny heads back to his bedroom and almost trips over a three
year old sitting on a potty.
THREE YEAR OLD
I'm pooping, Danny.
DANNY
(laughs)
· .I'm proud.
INT. DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
MR. NOONAN, Danny's father, is trying to eat breakfast and
read the newspaper while the kids pop in and out of the
room. He loves his children, but over the years, with each
new addition to the family, he's come to feel more and more
like a forgotten guest in his own home.
Danny comes through the dining room on his way to the kitchen.
DANNY
Hi, Dad. Can I ---
MR. NOONAN
No.
DANNY
(protesting)
You didn't even hear
MR. NOONAN
Whatever it is no!
Danny goes through the open door into the kitchen unfazed by
his father's churlishness.
INT. KITCHEN
MRS. NOONAN is busy making fried egg sandwiches. A crying
four year old clings to her apron while other kids pillage
the refrigerator, spill milk and orange juice, and slop
cereal into bowls. · The dog is barking, the phone is ringing
and the radio plays loudly. Danny gets a bowl and spoon from
the cupboard.

MRS. NOONAN
-- as soon us you guys get buck
from Little League, maybe we can
get some painting done on the house.
Thirteen year old SAM runs in and grabs a sandwich.
SAM
The Douglases got fake brick. You
don't have to paint it.
MRS. NOONAN
Hooray for the Douglases.
A baby in a high chair throws a cup.
MRS. NOONAN
Dory! Bad gir 1 !
(to the crying
four year old)
Sally, honey, you don't have to be
up yet. Go back to bed.
Danny grabs the Cheerios and is almost out the door.
MRS. NOONAN
Danny? No word from St. Copiu·s yet?
DANNY
(ev.:1si ve)
No, but I'm not so sure about that
place anymore. I talked to a guy
who went to colleue there. It's
right in the middle of a cornfield.
They get eight feet of snow
MRS. NOONAN
It's a fine college and you know it.
DANNY
I don't know anything.
He escapes to the dining room, and without sitting down, grabs
the pitcher of milk off the table and pours some on his.Cheerios.
MR. NOONAN
You get out yesterday?
DAN.NY
(spooning lots of
sugar on his cereal)
Twice. I caddied for Mr. Webb in
the morning and then doubles in the
afternoon.

MR. NOONAN
How much is that?
DANNY
Twelve-sixty plus about three bucks
in tips.
MR. NOONAN
Well? Put it in the college fund.
Danny sighs, puts down his bowl and goes to a kitchen cupboard,
digging into his pocket. Mr. Noonan watches him through the
open door. Mrs. Noon.:i.n is wiping up spills and feeding the
dog at the same time.
MRS. NOONAN
Maybe you should call the St. Copius
scholarship people. They shoula've
let you know by now. Sally, honey,
don't put eggs in your hair.
DANNY
(pulling bills
out of his pocket}
I heard there's only two girls there
and they're both nuns. This guy had
to take a cow to the prom and the
cow had to be in early.
MRS. NOONAN
Well, the M.:i.zen.:i.k boy went to
St. Copious and he had a marvelous
time.
·DANNY
(taking a cookie
jar off t he shelf)
IIe's the one who went out with the
cow.
He stuffs the money into the cookie Jar trying to hide it
from his father.
MR. NOONAN
(from th e dining room)
I saw that! That w.:i.s .:i.bout five
bucks and change.
Danny comes back into the dining room eating his cereal.
DANNY
I had a couple of burgers and some
Pepsis for lunch.
He fl ee s t owa r d the kitchen.

MR. NOONAN
How many Pepsis?
DANNY
(from the kitchen)
Four or five.
MR. NOONAN
What are you -- a diabetic!?
KIDS
Hit him, Dad! Get the strap!
Danny's a diatetic!
Danny dumps his dirty dishes in the sink.
MR. NOONAN
(shouts from
the dining room)
You're not leaving this house till
we settle this college thing.
DANNY
I'm just going upstairs for a
minute.
He dashes out of the kitchen and up the stairs.
MR. NOONAN
(o.s. to Mrs. Noonan)
I'm telling you, if he hasn't got
anything lined up by September,
I'm going to ask Tom Burdick to
put him on at the lumberyard.
INT. DANNY'S ROOM
He can hear his parents arguing as he rummages in his closet.
MRS. NOONAN (o.s.)
He's not going to work in the lumberyard!
Danny grabs a faded windbreaker and a letter dr .ops out of the
pocket. He reads it with a grim expression.
THE LETTER
It reads: The St. Copius scholarship foundation regrets to
inform you that your application for student aid has been
refused, etc.

DANNY

MR. NOONAN (o.s.)
Well, he's not going to b e a caddy
all his life, is he?
He folds up th e letter and hides it on a shelf.
MRS. NOONAN (v.o.)
Danny? De villed ham or tuna? I can't
open both.
DANNY
(shouts)
How about neith e r?
With the argument continuing downstairs, he goes to the
window and jumps out. For a moment we think he's committed
suicide.
EXT. DANNY'S WINDOW
He swings nimbly to a downspout, hops to a tree br a nch,
climbs through a weathered treehouse and slides down a
rop e to the ground. Then he jumps on a Se ars t e n speed
?ike and pedals away .
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET
Danny rid e s down a street lined with houses like his own.
EXT. ANOTHER STREET
Th e houses a re bigg e r, the lawns wider and greener, as
Danny cross e s over into a mor e exclusive section of the
suburbs.
EXT. ANOTHER STREET
Now Danny is riding past large mansions on rambling estat e s.
EXT. BUSHWOOD COUNTRY CLUB
Danny turns down a privat e driveway fl a nked by two stone
columns. On one column is a b r ass p la que that r e ads:
Bushwood Countr y Club. END CREDITS.

EXT. THE GOLF COURSE - A LITTLE LATER
Early morning mist rises from the golf course and shafts of
sunlight slant through the trees as we look at two figures
standing on the t e e five hundred yards away. One of the
figures swings, a click is heard and ball sails into the
air. It hangs for a long moment and drops right in the
middle of the fairway, two hundred yards from the green.
The golf e r hands his club to his caddy and starts walking
toward the ball .
As th e y approach, we begin to see them more clearly. It is
Danny, caddying for TY WEBB, a handsome, thirty-ish bachelor
with clear eyes and an air of relaxed s e lf control. His
outfit is all soft flannel and cashmere. Everything about -
him tells us that he is the perfect golfer.
TY AND DANNY
They walk along in quiet conversation. Danny tries hard to
match Ty's easy, elegant strid e .
DANNY
Mr. We bb, can I ask you something?
TY
Sure.
DANNY
When you were eighte en, do you
remember having trouble deciding
what you wanted to do with your ...
uh, you know . .• life?
TY
Sure. I didn't know whe th e r to go
to West Point, sail my f ather' s
ship to the islands or just take
a year off skiing in the ·Alps. Why?
Forget it.

DANNY
I don't think you'd
TY
Come on. I know what you me an. I
had the same problem at eighteen, at
twenty-one, tw enty-five, tw e nty-nine
and thirty-two - - and yesterday. I
almost blew my brains out with a
silv e r-plated Beretta. So wha t's
your problem?
CONTINUED

DANNY
What isn't my problem? Did you
have to take the Cooter Preference
test when you were a senior in
high school?
TY
Yes. It snid I should be n
firewatcher. What are you
supposed to be?
DANNY
An undernchiever.
(shakes his head)
I gotta go to college. I gotta!
TY
Do you want to go to college?
DANNY
In Nebraska? Besides, it costs
like eight thousand dollars a
year. My Dad can't afford it.
And I haven't even told him about
the scholarship I didn 1 t get.
I'll probably have to work in
a lumberyard for the rest of
rny life.
TY
What 1 s wrong with lumber. I own
two lumberyards.
DANNY
I notice you don 1 t spend too much
time there.
TY
I don't know where they are.
They reach Ty 1 s ball.
THE LAKE
Ty's ball rests near the edge of a beautiful lake that cuts
ncross the fairwny. On the opposite shore is a lovely
green flanked by sandtraps.
TY
Okay, Danny. I think you've
suffered enuugh. First lesson.
Did you sec Star Wars?

TY
All right. I'll be Alec Guiness

space farm.
DANNY
Thanks.
TY
(blindfolding
himself)
There's a force in the universe
that makes things happen. All
you have to do is get in touch
with it.
He fumbles with the clubs in his bag, feeling for a seven
iron. Finally he lifts the blindfold a little and takes
the right club. Then he goes to his ball and takes a
blindfolded practice swing.
THE BALL
TY
Find your center -- stop thinking
-- let it happen -- 'Be the ball 1
(he swings and
hits the ball)
It sails over the lake, hits high on the green and rolls back
down to within inches of the hole.
DANNY AND TY
Danny stands there amazed. Ty starts blindfolding him.
DANNY
(surprised)
What?
TY
Hit one. Try it.
Danny peeks to line up the shot, then lowers the blindfold
and gets ready to hit.
CONTINUED

11
TY
(droning
hypnotically)
Just relax -- be the ball -- find
·your center -- turn off all the
sound -- picture the shot -- be
completely still ---
DANNY
(impatiently)
It's a little hard with you talking
like that.
TY
Oh! All right I'll shut up --
J1m shutting up now -- I've stopped
talking.
Danny swings and hits the ball. Ty watches it rise and
drop into the lake.
DANNY
{taking off
the blindfold)
Where'd it go?
TY
Right in the lumberyard. We 1 ll
work on it -- honestly. Just
figure out what you really want.
Once you know, everything else
takes care of itself.
They walk off together. A mechanical roar is heard.
A HUGE TRACTOR MOWER
A huge grasscutter appears suddenly over a rise, it's big
plaid b]ower bags ballooning out from its sides. The
GROUNDSKEEPER waves casually to Ty and Danny from his
tractor seat as he rumbles past them.
CUT TO
EXT. THE STREET
A public transit bus stops across the street f r om the •.main
entrance to the club. The route sign on the front of the
bus reads : FROM TIIE Cl 'l'Y. Th e bus pulls awcJ.y revea1 ing a
half dozen teenag eC ADD-IE-S arriving for work. They cross
the street, rollick i ng and punching at each other. A few
Black and Latin Maids and Kitchen Helpers .::trrive with t hem. 
12
EXT. THE PARKING LOT
The caddies come up the driv eway. Leading the group is
TONY D 1 ANNUNZIO, nineteen, a tough-looking, inner-city
kid with disco haircut and a cigarette dangling negligently
from his lips. With him are his brothers -- ANGIE, a
mild-mannered, dopily smiling seventeen year old and
JOEY, fourteen, Bushwood's newest caddy, tough like Tony,
but cuter.
TONY
He accosts one of the maids.
TONY
Hey, Maria! The Immigration guy
was lookin 1 for you yest e rday.
You know, there's a law if you
screw an Italian, you're an
automatic citizen.
She laughs uncomprehendingly and continues talking in
Spanish to h e r friends.
Two other caddies have arrived with the D'Annunzio's - -
GOOFY, a gawky, bespectacled sixteen year old and
MOTORMOUTH, a fast-talking, eighteen year old class clown.
As they cut across th e parking lot, th e y check out the ca rs
of the club members.
A PORSCHE
MOTORMOUTH
(like an announcer)
We're here at the Thirteenth Annual
Bushwood Auto Show and what a
collection of four-wh e el fantasi e s
we have here, right Goofy?
(raps a stationwagon)
Here's a newcomer to this morning's
show, Mr. and Mrs. Newburger's 1981
Ford Country Squ a re.
GOOFY
Breathtakingly beautiful.
MOTORMOUTH
An absolute hog.

who are deliberately slow getting out of the way. The
horn honks frantically. The caddies slowly clear the
road as th e driver guns his motor. Th e moment they're
clear, he lurches forward to pass them.
JOEY
He does a flip off the car as if he's been hit and lands
sprawled on the grass.
JOEY
(rolling around
in mock agony)
Yaaaaaaaaaah!
THE PORSCHE
It screeches to a halt. The tinted window WHIRS down
revealing DR. BLAINE BEEPER, a rich, conceited big-city
surgeon . He looks back, shocked.
JOEY
DR. BEEPER
Oh my God!
He's on the grass twitching and flopping, the other
caddi e s standing around in horror .
THE PORSCHE
Beeper grabs his black doctor's bag and leaps from the car.
He stops.
THE DRIVEWAY
Both Joey and the caddies hav e disapp e ared.
BEEPER
He slams his doctor's bag against a tree trunk in a rage and
then looks at it realizing what he's done. He gives th e bag
a tentative shake and hears a $6,000 tinkle of brok e n glass
and instruments.

EXT. CADDYSHACK
Several caddies are lounging in the yard in front of the
caddyshack -- a one-story white fram e building with green
tile roof and green shutters . . Joey D'Annunzio practic e s
hook shots against a backboard attached to the wall.
GOOFY
He's sitting on a bench with RAY, an old, -professional caddy
we aring a dirty golf cap with an emblem from the 1946 Buick
Open. His sunta n ned arms are covered with tatoos. Goffy
dunks doughnuts into his coff e e as Ray t a lks.
RAY
I jumped ship in Hong Kong and
mad e my way to Tib e t whe r e I got
on as a looper at this golf club
up there in the Himalayan Mountains.
GOOFY
A looper?
RAY
A caddie · -- a jock! So I tell
' em I'm a pro, so who do they give
me? The Da lai Lama himself --
flowin' white robes and everything.
So I give him his driver and he tees
off -- right into this glacier and
his ball goes down this 10,000 foot

Dalai Lama says't
No.
'Shit.' Ye ah
know what els e .
Yeah.
GOOFY
RAY
'Shit! ' And you

Goofy stares a t him with his mouth full of doughnut.
DANNY

The ball sails high over the backboard and onto the roof
of the caddyshack.
JOEY
He glares at Danny.
JOEY
Thanks a lot, wipehole!
Danny goes into the caddyshack.
INT. CADDYSHACK
More caddies are lounging on benches, playing cards, etc.
Danny enters and goes to the window of the caddymaster's
office. Tony D'Annunzio is in the office.
DANNY
(holding up
a ticket)
Hiya, Tony. Where's Lou?
TONY
He went to the Pro Shop for a
minute. You wanna take over till
he gets back?
DANNY
Where you goin'?
Angie, Tony's r~t-like brother, appears.
ANGIE
Noonan, you wanna buy some clock
radios?
DANNY
Nah ---
ANGIE
Got any friends who want clock
radios?
DANNY
How many you got?
A..'t\JGIE
How many you need?
Angie walks away laughing. 
16
A BENCH
INJUN JOE, a big silent Indian of indeterminate age is playing
a game with FEEB, a twitching adult caddy with just a hint of
mental deficiency. They take turns bowling at wooden tees with
a golf ball, betting on each roll.
FEEB
(to Injun Joe)
Do you have a dime for ten pennies?
ANGIE
(making fun of him)
Hey, Feeb! What do you want a dime
for when you got ten pennies? Ten
is more than one.
FEEB
Pennies only work in the gumball
machine. I want M & M's.
JOEY
(joining Angie)
Here, Fe_eb. I'll give it to you.
Feeb holds out the pennies to Joey who slaps his hand,
scattering them all over the caddyshack.
DANNY
He turns to look and sees the little D'Annunzio's bothering
Feeb.
FEEB
DANNY
(to Tony)
Your brothers are animals.
(shouts at them)
Cut it o~t , moron!
He's on his knees looking for his pennies.
INJUN JOE
Here, Feeb. Here's a dime.
FEEB
Thank you, Injun Joe.
He gets off his knees, but Angie snatches his cap and tosses
it to Joey.

FEEB

Dan -- ny -- They got my hat again.
DANNY

Give it back to him, Joey.
JOEY
Here.

back to his brother)
Angie!
Danny turns to Angie.
ANGIE.
You want it, Noonan? Take it.
Danny grabs for him but Joey jumps on his back and they go down,
knocking over a . gumball machine which breaks and sends gumballs
rolling all over the place. Then Angie jumps on Danny to help
Joey, but Tony arrives and yanks ~~gie to his feet, cuffing him
sharply a couple of times. Danny gets a good grip on Little
Jo ey 1 s neck and pastes him to the wall.
Younger caddies scurry around after the pennies and gumballs.
Injun Joe la u ghs .
THE DOOR
LOU LOOMIS, the Caddymaster, enters. He's a likable master
sergeant type with a veneer of toughness to keep the caddies
in lin e .
LOU
· (over the noise)
Okay, break it up! Pipe down!
All of you!
Angie takes on last wild swing at Danny but accidentally hits
Lou on th e arm. The caddies go s11ddenly q uiet. Lou grabs Angie
and push e s him over to a sign on the wall.
LOU
Wha t.-~·s the sign say?
ANGIE
No fighting.
LOU
What's it mean?

ANGIE

What is this? I count on you guys
to keep these monkeys in line.
(sguintincJ

What's that candy wrapper doing
there?
(Joey looks down)
Don't you see it? Well, pick it up!
Joey picks it up. Lou addresses all the caddies.
LOU
(turning to
cowed caddies)
Now, I'm not going to have any
trouble from you guys this summer.
I'll put it right on the line --
there's been a lot of complaints
already -- fooling around on the
course. Bad language. Smoking
grass. Poor caduying.
(the caddies
hang their heads
in mock shame)
So if you want to get fired, just
keep it u.9. ·
Somebody belches. Lou turns to Joey, hands him a kleenex
for his bloody nose.
LOU
And another thing. If any of you
are thinking of going to college--
Noonan, you may want to listen to
this -- Carl Lipbaum died last
week in summer school from a severe
anxiety attack.
The caddies mutter in surprise and sympathy.
GOOFY
I heard he swallowed his vomit
during a test.

LOU
However it happened, he was a good
caddy and a good kid.
TONY
He was a brown nose, Lou. You
hated him.
LOU
Anyway, that means the caddy scholarship is available -- and anyone who
wants it should go see Judge Smails.
MOTORMOUTH
And kiss his ass.
LOU
That would help. Now let's go.
We got golfers waiting.
The caddies start to file out the door.
LOU
You, Joey! Pick up that blood.
INT. MEN.' S LOCKER ROOM
A cloud of steam billows from the steam room as the door
opens. · Several portly members can be seen through the mist.
They look like ancient Roman senators wrapped in their sheets
and towels. Several other members stand or sit around the
locker room, playing cards or changing in and out of golf
and tenni s togs.
JUDGE SMAILS
A rich old fa rt and presiding head of Bushwood holds out a
pair of golf shoes to SMOKE, the black locker room attendant.
SMAILS
(irritably)
Oh, Westinghouse! Look at the
built-up wax on these shoes. This
is quality leather. I want the
wax stripped, and I want them

bags about five miles. Righ t , Da nny?
DANNY
That's right, Mouth. It's a. grueling
t e st of strength and ignorance.
EXT. THE PRACTICE TEE
Danny approach e s the practice tee and sees SAM RIVIERA, the
club's golf pro, finishing a l e sson with MR. & MRS. HAVERCAMP.
Sam is about forty, deeply tanned and dressed in pastel golf
sweater and slacks. The Hav e rcamps are a cheerfully senile
old coupl e , dress e d in matching outfits, who keep gamely
trying to hit their practice shots. They succeed only in
gouging deep holes around their golf balls as they repeatedly
swing and miss.
SAM
He watches with we ary pati e nce as th e Havercamps in e ptly flail
away.
SAM
Oka y, Mr. Haverc amp, try looking
at the ball this time . Mrs. Havercamp,
you've g ot your clubface turn e d around

The old man swings and goug e s a hug e divot.
Whee !
MRS. HAVERCAMP

and hits a short
dribbler)

Danny picks up th ei r matching baby-blue golf bags and approaches
the Havercamps.
DANNY
Morning, Mr. Havercarnp, Mrs. Havercamp.
I'm Danny. You're next up.
MR. HAVERCAMP
Let's go, Dolly. I'm hot today.
THE FIRST TEE
MRS. HAVERCAMP is about to drive.
MRS. HAVERCAMP
(winding up)
Ready for blast-off! Whee!
She tops the ball and it rolls thirty f eet down the fairway.
MR. HAVERCAMP
(applauding)
That was ·. a peach, hon!
SAM RIVIERA
He stands next to Danny watching Mr. Havercamp.
SAM
(shouting
encouragement)
Excell en t!
(to Danny)
Good luck, Noonan. This could

ever played.
THE SNACK SHOP
Several tables are filled with membe rs having sandwiches
and beer.
THE COUNTER
MAGGIE, a very cute, rosy-checked Irish girl in her early
twenti es . When her last customer ex its, she turns to the
frozen custard machine, tak es the bigger size sugar con e
and dispenses for herself an incredi~ly tall, very precarious
Softee Freeze. She takes a happy lick and spots Danny coming
off the ninth. 
24
DANNY
He trudges up to the Snack Shop completely exhausted, his
shirt soaked with sweat. Maggie smiles and signals cdvertly
to him. Danny slips around to the back of the Snack Shop.
THF. BACK DOOR
Maggie comes out and gives him a free burger and a shake.
DANNY
Hi, Maggie.
MAGGIE
Hi. Don't let the Judge sec you.
(Danny tries to
steal a kiss but
she ducks it)
Not here.
(she hands him
a pair of boys
underpants)
You left these last night when you
ran off.
DANNY
(embraces her)
I had to babysit. You want to go
out again tonight?
MAGGIE
Out to my room? Look, Danny, I
like you a lot, but let's not make
a. regular thing out of it. We1 ve
got a good friendship going and
I'd like to keep it that way.
Besides, I got some bad news today.
DANNY
(nibbles her ear}
What?
MAGGIE

They wun't renew my work permit.
I have to go back to Ireland at

If I were married to an American,

DANNY

No problem. You could live in

MAGGIE
Aren't you going to college?
DANNY
Doesn't look like it -- unless
I get the caddy scholarship.
MAGGIE
You'll get it.
( teasing)
And we'll get married -- just for
show, of course -- and I'll be a
stewardess for Aer Lingus and be
flyin' all over the place. Now
doesn't that sound like something?
He comes around the corner of the Snack Shop.
TONY
Aer Lingus? I know her sister --
Connie.
MAGGIE
(laughing)
You've got a smart mouth.
TONY
That's what Connie told me.
Danny sees .Mr. Havercamp looking around for him.

Hey, Maggie. The Irmnigration guy

THE FAIRWAY
SANDY MacFIDDISH, Bushwood's Scottish greenskeeper, is
stunding by his electric utility cart with his tartan tam
in his hands, taking orders from Judge Smails.
A MOLE
SMAILS
(irate)
Do you know what moles can do to
a golf course?
SANDY
They must be tunnclin' in from
that construction site across
-the road.
SMAILS
I don't care where they 1 re corning
from. I wunt every last mole
extermianted or Bushwood will
start looking for a new g~eenskeeper. Is that clear?
SANDY
Very clear, sir.
It pops its head out of a hole and cocks its head. Then it
hears a noise and ducks back in.
SANDY
He drags a thick water hose onto the fairway and sticks the
nozzle into the mole hole.
EIGHTEENTH GREEN
Danny comes off the course really exhausted now, followed
by the Havercamps, indomitable despite having played the
worst round of golf imaginable.
DANNY
(handing them
their scorecards)
I get 188 for you, sir, and 202
for your wife.
MR. IIAVERCAMP
Hold on a minute, son. I get 186
for me. Well, let's not make a
federal case out of it. This is
for you -- and thanks.
(hands him a tip) 
27
DANNY'S HAND
holding two shiny quarters.
DANNY
DANNY (v. o.)
(disappointed)
Thank you, sir.
He trots wearily across a fairway lugging both golf bags.
He trips over Sandy's water hose and falls flat on his face.
The clubs spill out of the bags with a noisy clatter and
two dozen golf balls go rolling off in all directions.
DANNY
(totally exasperated)
God damn son of a bitch!
His anger is cut short as he spots someone walking toward him.
LACEY
Danny sees LACEY UNDERALL, a very beautiful girl, walking
toward him in a short, very alluring tennis skirt. She
has slim, shapely legs, long, golden hair, a great tan and
a cover-girl complexion. She 1 s carrying a tennis racquet
and with one smooth move, she bends slightly and scoops
up one of the golf balls that rolled away from Danny.
LACEY
(tossing the
golf ball to Danny)
Walk much?
DANNY
(stuffing the clubs
back into the bags)
Oh, no. I just -- I was just
resting.
She smiles and walks away with a toss of her curls. Her
walk is both sexy and athletic. She absently brushes a
fly off the back of her thigh with her racquet.
DANNY
He gapes at her and suddenly water comes shooting up out of
a dozen moleholes, falling like rain on Danny. 
28
THE HAVERCAMPS
They stand looking up at the sky, getting completely drenched.
EXT. THE TENNIS COURTS
The tennis courts are hidden behind dense bushes but the
pock-pock of balls being hit can be heard as Danny saunters
by. He nods casually to a pair of golfers as they pass,
then as soon as they're gone, Danny ducks into the bushes.
DANNY
We can hear the sound of youthful laughter as Danny peers
through the hurricane fence at the tennis courts.
THE TENNIS COURTS
Lacey is playing with three young club MEMBERS. Her partner
is SPAULDING SMAILS, a pudgy, truculent-looking seventeen year
old -- Judge Smails 1 spoiled grandson.
Lacey hits a nice backhand, then waits for there .turn, but
Spaulding insists on taking the next shot.
SPAULDING
I got it! It's mine!
Lacey backs off relucantly and watches Spaulding hit a
lame forehand right into the net.
SPAULDING
Shit!
(blaming Lacey)
Will you stay out of my way!
He flings his racquet in disgust.
LACEY
Christ, Spaulding! I hope you
screw better than you play tennis.
THEIR OPPONENTS
NOBLE NOYES, a tomboyish girl with fuzzy red hair walks up
to .the net.
NOBLE
Hey, Lacey, are you coming to the
dinner dance tonight?
CON'fINUED

29
LACEY
Will it be any good?
NOBLE
No.
LACEY
(walking back
to the base
line to serve)
You talked me into it.
THE BUSHES
The_ TENNIS PRO, a middle-aged, red-faced man wearing whites
and a floppy tennis hat, walks by and sees Danny's ass
sticking out of the bushes. He puts down the basket of
practice balls he 1 s carrying; winds up to swing with his
racquet, and swats Danny hard on the backside.
INT. CLUB KITCHEN
Danny comes flying through the door into a maelstrom of
activity. It's all banging pots, and sizzling stoves with
food and people flying everywhere. He's in a white jacket,
carrying a big tray of dirty dishes.
THE COOK
CHARLIE, the Hungarian cook is screaming at everyone as he
carves a big roast with a huge butcher knife.
A BUSBOY
CHARLIE
(pounding the knife)
This! 'rhis !

sponge in half}

The huge knife sticks in the wall just in front of his face.
He drops two racks . full of glasses.

MAGGIE
She snags Danny and pulls him through the swinging doors.
CLUB DINING ROOM
Danny and Maggie bustle over to a s e rvice area and star t
loading trays with ice water, rolls and butt e r. Danny
looks around the room and spots Lacey.
LACEY UNDERALL
She's sitting at a table with Judg e Smails, his wife
MRS. SMAILS, a Wagnerian dowager, Spaulding Smails, the
Judge's loathsome grandson, Dr. Beeper and his wif e , CONNIE
BEEPER who is obviously much too charming and attractive
to be married to a creep like Dr. Beeper.
Lacey looks gr e at in an off-the-shoulder white cotton dress.
Judge Smails is handling the . introductions when Danny and
Maggie arrive with the bread and butter.
JUDGE SMAILS
(clasping Lac e y's
luscious shoulder)
Lac ey Under ·a11, certainly you
' remember Dr. and Constance Beeper
from Hope Sound last winter. Lacey's
mother has sent us her daughter for
the summer. I think she's being
saved for a real debutante ball.
DR. BEEPER
(l ee ring obnoxiously)
Of course.
CONNIE BEEPER

g-string bathing suit at the b~ach.
The doc t or here almost had a heart

Danny has worked his way around to Lacey and is loading up
her plate with butt er -- a bout a pourld df'tt.
LACEY
(noticing)
I think I have enough butter now.
DANNY
Oh, sorry.
(backs off)
If you need anything
Maggi e drags him away.
THE BUSSING STATION
Danny and Maggie arrange bowls of salad on their trays.
MAGGIE
(burned)
Is that why you showed up tonight?
DANNY
Why?
MAGGIE
Lacey Underall. She's the bigg es t
whor e in Philadelphia •.. It's all over
the club.
Danny looks at Lacey with even greater interest. The NOISE
of a glass breaking startles him.
ANOTHER TABLE
In contrast to the Smails' table, these guests are having a
rollicking good time. It's the FUN COUPLES: SCOTT, GATSBY
and their foxy, tipsy wiv es , SUKI and WALLY. They are hosting
a new face at Bushwood, AL CZERNAK, a stocky., balding, cement
block in a flaming leisure suit, His voic e is lou d , his
mann er is deliberately offensive and he seems to r ea lly en joy
the company of these rich, young marrieds.
Danny arrives to clean up the broken glass.

AL CZERNAK
••• So when Mona died suddenly last
winter, I said to myself, 'Al, if
you keep bustin' your hump sixteen,
twenty hours a day, you're gonna

He farts loudly; Danny can't believe it.
Sorry
AL CZERNAK

The Fun Couples laugh.
So I
AL CZERNAK
(catches Maggie's
eye, grabbing her
skirt)
Hey, doll, could you scare up another
round for our table -- and tell the
cook this is low-grade dog food,
okay? And happy birthday.
He slips a twenty into Maggie's hand.
MAGGIE
(delighted)
Oh! Thank you.

AL CZERNAK
(to Fun Couples)
Gad, I've had better food at the
ballgame.
The Fun Couples break up again. Danny stares at Al, enjoying
his outrageous antics.
AL CZERNAK
Anyway, so now I just keep to real
estate -- I mean with the market
these days, if you own anything
but dirt, you own a popcorn fart.
(notices Danny
laughing behind
him, slips him $5)
Hey, junior, ask our waitress if she
want s to get married. 
33
SMAILS' TABLE
The stiffs all stare at Czernak. Only Connie is amused,
Lacey is just bored.
CZERNAK
Al notices Judge Smails staring coldly at him from the
next table.
AL CZERNKA
Hey, who's the mummy?
(waves)
Hiya.
He pretends to blow his nose in his loud tie; Smails' jaw drops.
THE HUNGARIAN COOK (CHARLIE} - KITCHEN
He screams, wide-eyed, into the camera.
CHARLIE
Dog food?!!
He grabs his cleaver and heads for the door. Two assistants
tackle the enraged alien, knocking over a tower of freshlywashed pots, causing a tremendous din.
CZERNAK'S TABLE
Al Czernak's table bursts into loud applause at the crash
arid continued commotion behind the kitchen door.
LACEY
Danny bobbles a dish of ice cream at the sound of the
tremendous crash in the kitchen and spills a few drops
of hot fudge on Lacey's shoulder.
LACEY
Ow! That's hot!
CLOSE-UP - LACEY'S SHOULDER
A couple of drops of hot chocolate sauce run down Lacey's
bare shoulder. 
3~
DANNY
He stares, open-mouthed, reaches into his pocket, pulls out
the underpants Maggie gave him earlier, and starts wiping
Lacey's shoulder with them.
LACEY
She stares at the underpants, then at Danny. Danny beats
it. A band starts playing in the next room.
INT. CLUB BALLROOM
Members and guests drift into the wood-panelled lounge and
ballroom area. A very boring, six-piece COMBO is playing
a bad Beatle tune at half-speed.
THE FUN COUPLES
They stop at the edge of the the dance floor with Al Czernak,
watching the club members as they dance sedately.
CZERNAK
(loud)
Yike -- Dance of the Living Dead!
The dancing COUPLES steer clear of Czernak, afraid to get
too close to his pink leisure wear.
THE BAR
Handsome, slick Tony D'Annunzio is moonlighting as a
bartender. He makes an elaborate show of mixing drinks
while he talks a mildly sarcastic stream of patter to
the slightly deaf and nearly senile Havercamps.
TONY
So how was dinner, huh? You
each get a special bowl of mush?
(pouring
their drinks}
Here you go -- two special extraflat Shirley Temples straight up

Danny enters lugging a bin of ice.

Danny looks at her with even greater interest. Two young
PRE-DEBS come up to the bar.
F'IRST GIRL

TONY
What? Two T&A's? You want to

The girls giggle as Tony mixes their drinks. One of them
smiles coyly at Danny. He smiles back politely, but ke eps
watching Lacey.
TY WEBB
He wanders into the ballroom looking very suave in his
hand-tailored evening wear. He lights a cigarette and
leans against the wall as he surveys the action in th e

Czernak and Suki are dancing on the fringe of the dance

The word "DAMAGED" is stamped on the ball in big red letters.
A putter taps the ball out of frame.
PRACTICE GREEN
Spaulding Smails, the Judge's grandson, is practicing putting,
cursing every time he misses. Motormouth and Goofy stop to watch.
SPAULDING
Dammit!
THE STARTING BOARD
Lou, the caddymast er , is chalking the names of the players on a
board near the first tee. The caddies are waiting for their
assignments. Danny looks ne r vous.

Okay, Smails, Smails , Beeper and

The caddies hoot derisively.

JOEY crosses to the tee, hobbling under the weight of Czernak's
incredible bag as the caddies cheer and jeer at him.
JOEY

You want your driver?

His eyes go wide, his face turns bright red and his mouth
goes up and down but no sound comes out. He grabs a golf
club leaning up again st -the wall and charges at Danny.
Danny drops the cognac and ci gar and gr abs for his underpants. Srnails swings at him with the golf club but Danny

Danny bounds across the bed trying to put on his underpants
as he runs. Smails swings again but Danny catches his foot
in his underwear and falls. Smails club whizzes over his
head and knocks out one of the columns of his four-poster.

What an afternoon! Are we still having
tea?
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Danny comes running out of Mrs. Smails bedroom. The Maid is
still mopping the marble floor, talking to a Butler holding
a tea service on a tray.
Danny runs by almost knocking over the Butler who spins like
a top but keeps the tea service from falling. Danny does a
perfect stand-up slide on the wet floor that carries him all
the way to the backstairs at the end of the hall.

a face behind her back, snatches the unwrapped Baby Ruth from
Grace and tosses it into the pool.
MRS. SMAILS
She shouts at the caddies, but they are slow to respond. The

SCREAM causes them both to turn at once.

She's in the pool pointing at the floating candy bar, screaming
hysterically.
